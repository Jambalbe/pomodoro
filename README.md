# pomodoro
A small pomodoro GUI for Windows/Linux created with PyQt5.


The "Timer" tab allows you to set your desired work and rest times aswell as other settings. Starting, pausing and reseting the timer can also be done in this tab. Settings made in this tab, except repetitions and mode, are saved across multiple instances.

The "Tasks" tab allows you to write down your tasks that you want to accomplish in that pomodoro session. Its a good practice to break down big tasks into smaller tasks. Don't worry if you can't finish all your tasks in a session, since the tasks are also saved across multiple instances. You can mark a task as "finished" by double clicking it. Finished tasks are not saved.

The "Statistics" tab helps you keep track of how much you have worked, rested and the total amount (rest time + work time) you have spend.
